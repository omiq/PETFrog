## Aim of the game



Bring your froggies home, by avoiding traffic, riding river obstacles, until you can boop the little ðŸ’— heart symbols.

Get six frogs home and you win.

Cars and trucks are deadly (naturally), as are Crocodiles mouths.

River is deadly in the flow of the obstacles, but banks are safe. You can ride logs, turtles, and croc bodies.

Good luck!
